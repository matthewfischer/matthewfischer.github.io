From roughly 2010 to 2017 I had a fairly active blog on my site. As I switched jobs and changed roles away from pure epen source work, the site updates slowed and then stopped. I've recently had the itch to get back into having a personal blog site and so I am giving this a try at github pages instead of my personal domain.  Since I've changed roles, this will mainly be around designing processes and teams that scale well. Will it Scale isn't about your database, it's about your database team, and your database upgrade & incident management processes. Building teams, tools, and processes that scale are the only way to build a successful organization and product. I hope to convey my thoughts along with failures and successes here over time.

Stay tuned for more updates!
