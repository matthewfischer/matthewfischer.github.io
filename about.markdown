Welcome to Will It Scale - my personal blog with my own thoughts an opinions on processes and tools that scale well (and those that don't) in my career.

# About Me

I'm a Cloud Software Engineer (at heart) who spends time thinking about how leadership can help enable teams to have more effective structure, tools, and processes. Making teams more efficient, building a sense of ownership and pride, and ensuring open communications are my current goals - as well as shipping great scalable software. I do still get my hands dirty in code when I can!

You can see some of my [conference talks on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPi3S9VFb4qOsCL_NH32nSEH70yi2i6EC) - although it's been awhile since I did one.

I also helped [co-author a book on OpenStack deployments](https://www.amazon.com/Common-OpenStack-Deployments-Real-World-Administrators/dp/0134086236), including all the automation to get you started.
